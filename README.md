# Hi there, I'm Vaskin 👋

## 📜 Bio
I'm a seasoned technologist and AI innovator with over 30 years of experience in software development and internet technologies. As the founder of Agentic Insights ([GitHub](https://github.com/Agentic-Insights) | [Website](https://agenticinsights.com)), I specialize in AI engineering, focusing on Large Language Models, multi-modal systems, and intelligent agents. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of AI to create transformative solutions for complex challenges.

## 🔭 Current Work

### [Codebase Context Specification (CCS)](https://github.com/Agentic-Insights/codebase-context-spec)
Pioneered the Codebase Context Specification, a groundbreaking approach to enhancing AI-assisted development:
- 📦 [NPM Package: codebase-context-lint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codebase-context-lint)
- 📰 [Detailed Article on Substack](https://agenticinsights.substack.com/p/codebase-context-specification-rfc)
- 🎥 [AI Journalist Coverage on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcMwYL2Wa8g)

> "It's like a cross between README file meets a SYSTEM prompt"

### [Semantic Kernel Ollama](https://github.com/Agentic-Insights/sk-python-labs)
New Semantic Kernel QuickStart - demonstrating how to use Ollama and Groq with SK.

### [LangChain 101 Tutorial](https://github.com/Agentic-Insights/langchain-labs)
New Tutorial for LangChain - demonstrating tool use. A real 101 on the modern 0.2 version of LangChain.

I'm diving deep into AI technologies:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) - Sonnet 3.5, Llama 3.1
- Multi-modal Models - Audio focus, Vapi.ai, [Vocode.dev](https://www.vocode.dev/v)
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI Agents - LangChain, LangGraph, AgentOps, AutoGen, CrewAI, Experts.js

## 🌱 Learning
Expanding my expertise in:
- LangChain
- LlamaIndex
- Fine Tuning Techniques
- Machine Learning
- OpenAI Assistants

## 👯 Collaboration
Excited to collaborate on:
- Proof of Concept Projects
- Research in LLM and Generative AI Domains
- Implementing and expanding the Codebase Context Specification
